Home Loan Approval EDA and Prediction
This EDA and prediction project aims to explore the factors that influence home loan approval and to develop a model that can predict the likelihood of approval for a given borrower.
The project uses a dataset of home loan approval to train a machine learning model.
Once the model is trained, it can be used to predict the likelihood of approval for new loan applications.
